    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <script>
        // This is a JavaScript function definition, we need to use the "function" keyword
        // Functions are awesome - you write code 1 time and can reuse it throughout your program
        // Functions help organize code
        // Function names should usually be some sort of action
        // Alawys include the () - sometimes there be variable(s) in between the () or they may be empty
        // Always make sure there are a matching set of {}
        function runCalc(){ // Do not mix ; and {}
            // Whatever code is inbetween the curly braces belongs to this function
            // We will create a variable called num1, and we will give it a default value of 0
            // JavaScript should assume this is a numeric datatype
            var num1 = 0;
            var num2 = 0;

            // We want to prompt the user for a number, using the built in JavaScript prompt function
            // The prompt function takes an argument (variable) - the text that will be shown to the user with the prompt
            // The prompt function returns the value that the user entered in
            // Set the num1 variable equal to the value the user entered in

            // do while loops will run at least 1 time, and then it can run as many times as needed. while loops may run 0 times
            do{
                // Make the user enter a number, this loop will run until a number is entered
                num1 = prompt("Please enter number 1:"); // Most lines of JavaScript need a ; at the end 
                // if isNotaNumber is true (they entered text) or the users enter a 0, the loop will keep running
            } while (isNaN(num1) || num1 == 0); // Because the query comes after the curly braces, you need to use a semicolon at the end of the function
            
            do{
                num2 = prompt("Please enter number 2:"); // Get another number from the user and assign it to the num2 variable
            } while (isNaN(num2) || num2 == 0);
            

            // Lets add num1 and num2 together and store that value in the total variable
            // The built in JavaScript function parseInt makes sure that JavaScript treats the num1 and num2 variables as integers
            var total = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);

            // Call the built in JavaScript function called alert - this will show a message to the user
            // It should show our numbers and the total
            console.log("The total of " + num1 + " plus " + num2 + " is " + total);
        }

        // We have created the function, now we need to call it so that the function code will run
        // The () are blank because we dont need to pass any information into this function
        runCalc();
        // console.log(num1, num2);

        // The code here does not belong to the function

    <h2>Decision Logic (if else)</h2>

    <script>
        // Creating a variable called age with a default value of 5
        // 1 equals sign is assignment, the variable on the left is assigned to the value on the right
        // 2 equals signs are a boolean operator to check for equality
        var age = 5;

        // if statements test a value, if the test results in true, it runs it's block of code
        if (age == 5){
            // This code will run if the value of the age variable is 5
            console.log("age = " + age);
        }
        
        // else if statements will be check when the previous if statement was untrue
        else if (age == 6){
            // This code will run if the value of the age variable is 6
            console.log("age = " + age);
        }

        // The else statement is a catch-all, it will run if none of the previous if/else if statements were true
        // This code will run if the value of age was not 5 or 6
        else { console.log("age was not 5 or 6") }

    </script>

    <h2>Loops</h2>

    <script>
        // Loops run code repeatedly
        // They are great for displaying data
        // There are 2 basic types of loops: for loops and while loops

        // for loops are generally used when you know how many times you want the code to run
        // The first part of our for loop is a counter variable, an dwe are setting it to a default value of 0
        // The second part is the condition that the loop will test for on each run, the code will run as long as this condition is true
        // The third is incrementing the counter variable each time the loop runs, i++ is the same thing as  i = i + 1

        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            console.log("i = " + i);
        }

        // while loops are generally used when you do not know ho wmany times you want the code to run

        // Counter variable, set to a default value of 0
        var counter = 0;
        // wihle loop will run until the counter is equal to 5
        while(counter < 5){
            // Display the value of counter in the console
            console.log("counter = " + counter);

            // Increase the value of counter by 1 every time the while loop runs
            counter++;
        }
